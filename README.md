## Running CMSclassifier

Gene expression data used in the modelling for CMSclassifier was downloaded from [synapse](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn4983432). RF and SS CMSclassifier methods were both run on the complete dataset in R using ____________. Only TCGA samples which matched the [described CMS class assigned in the original paper](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn4978510) were reatined and saved.
